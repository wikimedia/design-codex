# Architecture Decision Records

An architecture decision record (ADR) documents an important software design decision by explaining the context and consequences of the decision.

The ADRs in this repo follow [this template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md).

For convenience a [template file](./NNNN-adr-template.md) is provided in this folder. When writing a new ADR copy the template and start from there.
