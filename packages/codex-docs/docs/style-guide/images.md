# Images

Images are found in Wikimedia projects as standalone contributions and as supplementary content to
engage and communicate with individuals.

## Image selection

![A bicycle with a caption.](../assets/visual-styles/images/01_images-bicycle.png)

We use images to help increase understanding and engagement with individuals. When using images in
our projects, the selections follow general guidelines:
- **Contextually relevant.** Images relate directly to the subject of the article. An article about
  bicycles should contain images that relate to, support, and enrich content about bicycles.
- **Neutral point of view.** When showing an image of a shark, consider a side profile photograph
  of a shark instead of an action shot of a shark preying on another animal.
- **Representation in the most accurate medium.** Use a photograph of Rosalind Franklin in her
  biographic profile, rather than an artistic drawing. In an article about Donald Duck, use a
  cartoon still of Donald Duck instead of a photograph of a duck.
- **Good resolution quality.** Images should be high quality.
- **Respects copyright.** Images should be correctly attributed. Use Creative Commons, Fair use, or
  Public Domain images stored on Wikimedia Commons, and other sources that comply correctly with
  copyright licensing.
