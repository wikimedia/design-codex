# Contributing guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! There are several ways to contribute:

- Adding or commenting on tasks in our project management system, Phabricator (links below)
- Contributing to the design process
- Suggesting new components and design tokens
- Writing and submitting code
- Reviewing code
- Updating and expanding library documentation

Contributions to Codex are covered by the [MediaWiki Code of Conduct](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

## How to stay up-to-date

To keep all those interested in using or contributing to Codex up-to-date on topics of design,
development, roadmaps, and releases, the Design Systems Team will:

- Use the [Codex workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/5587/) in Phabricator to
  publicly track the work, giving others the opportunity to subscribe to tasks, add comments, or
  claim tasks.
- Keep our [team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team) up-to-date with information about our work and how to contact us
- Include release notes with every release and send minor+ release summaries out to the following
  mailing lists:
    - [wikitech-l](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/wikitech-l.lists.wikimedia.org/)
    - [design.public](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/design.lists.wikimedia.org/)
- Document technical decisions about the library in the [ADRs section](/adrs/introduction)

## Task tracking

Work on the library is tracked on the [Codex workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/5587/)
in Phabricator.

> I want to know the status of something

Check the workboard to see if a task exists for that work. If so, the task will be in the column
that represents its current status. If not, you can add a task (see below) or contact us (see the
[Design Systems Team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team) on mediawiki.org).

> I want to request a feature

You are welcome to add new tasks with the `Codex` tag. New tasks will go into
our backlog column and will be triaged regularly. Please remember that Codex is maintained by a
nonprofit—we won't be able to meet all feature requests, and it might take time to get to your
request.

> I want to follow parts of your work

Create a Phabricator account and add yourself as a subscriber to a task to get notified when
updates are made.

> I want to contribute to a task

Great! Add or claim a task as soon as you decide to work on it. This will help avoid overlapping,
duplicate, or conflicting work. Keep the task in the appropriate column on the workboard to help
communicate its current status. If you're creating a task, add as much detail as you can about the
scope of the task: for example, what needs to be completed before the task can be considered
"done"?
