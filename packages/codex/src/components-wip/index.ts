// Add components that are still in development to this file, as follows:
// import CdxComponentName from './component-name/ComponentName.vue';
//
// export {
//     CdxComponentName
// };
//
// Note that when all components in this list are removed, you should remove the imports and the
// `export` statement and instead uncomment the line with `export default {};`.
// This export default is needed to prevent Jest from failing with
// "Coverage data for src/components-wip was not found". When adding a new component here, you
// should CHANGE THIS to "export", removing the "default". See also the import+export example above.
import CdxMenuButton from './menu-button/MenuButton.vue';

export {
	CdxMenuButton
};
